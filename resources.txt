Main.js

updatePositions() - moved items selector outside of function since it won't change.  No need to run this function multiple times.  Also moved scroll position.

during pizza creation, moved selector outside of loop.  Updated changePizzaSlices to use variable
to cut down on more unneeded queries.  And moved variables outside of loop since they only need to be calculated once
